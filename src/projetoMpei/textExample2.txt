I looked up to the clear sky and the frenzied pulses sent out by my heart pounded so hard at my chest. It felt like as if a drill were slowly poking a hole across a sheet of delicate plywood. The adrenalin rush sent an electric impulse swirling down my spine giving my the shivers which you get when you listen to good music. I was breathing in a haphazard manner and the mesmerizing view completely took over my body. It was like a drug that got me addicted and brought me the instantaneous inner peace like as if my soul had been pulled out of its cage. It felt like witch craft. My senses were blocked and I couldn't move a muscle nor hear anything. Time froze and only my eyes were cooperated to take a mental picture of this jet black spot dangling on the great canvas of Nature.
